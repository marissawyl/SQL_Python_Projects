# 📊 Customer Segmentation & Revenue Analysis (RFM)

## Introduction
Understanding customer value goes beyond knowing who buys the most. In many businesses, a small group of customers often contributes a large portion of revenue, but high revenue does not always mean high profit.

This project uses RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers and connects those segments with product-level revenue and margin performance.
The goal is to better understand customer behavior, product demand, and profitability trade-offs in a practical, business-oriented way.

## Business Questions
This project focuses on understanding customer value and product performance using RFM segmentation. The analysis is guided by the following business questions:
Q1. How are customers spread across different RFM segments, and which segments generate the most revenue relative to their size?
Q2. How are recency, frequency, and monetary value distributed across customers?
Q3. Which product categories generate the highest sales volume among high-value customer segments, such as Champions and Loyal customers?
Q4. How does revenue break down by category and subcategory for high-value customer segments?
Q5. Which categories drive revenue, and which ones are actually more profitable?
