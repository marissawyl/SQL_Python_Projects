# 📊 Funnel, Drop-off, and Behavior Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes the customer purchase funnel and drop-off behavior in an e-commerce dataset using SQL and Python. The analysis focuses on understanding where customers drop off, how behavior differs by cohort, and which order statuses contribute most to funnel leakage.  
The goal is not only to compute metrics, but to explain customer behavior across funnel stages and translate it into actionable insights.
